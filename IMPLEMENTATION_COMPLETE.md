# Implementation Complete - File Upload and Sub-Area Selector

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented.

## Problem Statement (Original - Spanish)
1. **File Upload Issue**: Error in `/m_capacitaciones/formulario.html` - files need to be saved to `/m_capacitaciones/assets/docs/[formulario_id]/archivos/`
2. **Sub-Area Selector**: Module `/m_capacitaciones/programacion.html` needs a sub-area selector based on `adm_área` table, and the field must be mandatory
3. **Role Restrictions**: Specific roles enabled for programming: Capacitador SIE, GH, TI, MT, IND, ADM, AGR, Administrador, Capacitador, Aux_Capacitador

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ File Upload Fix
- **Status**: Complete
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `file_upload_api.php` to use correct directory structure: `/m_capacitaciones/assets/docs/[id]/archivos/`
  - Modified directory creation logic
  - Updated file path references in all operations (upload, get, delete)
  - Added proper validation and security measures

### ✅ Sub-Area Selector - Mandatory Field
- **Status**: Complete
- **Changes**:
  - Made `sub_area` field mandatory in HTML and JavaScript
  - Updated backend validation in `programacion_api.php`
  - Implemented dynamic loading from `adm_área` table
  - Field converts between text input and select dropdown based on available options
  - All validation enforces the mandatory requirement

### ✅ Role-Based Access Control
- **Status**: Complete

  - Supports both space and underscore formats for role names
  - All 10 specified roles are included

## Files Modified

1. `m_capacitaciones/assets/php/file_upload_api.php` - File upload directory structure
2. `m_capacitaciones/assets/php/programacion_api.php` - Sub-area loading and role filtering
3. `m_capacitaciones/assets/js/programacion.js` - Sub-area dynamic field management
4. `m_capacitaciones/programacion.html` - Sub-area required field and role restrictions
5. `.gitignore` - Exclude uploaded files from git

## Files Added

1. `m_capacitaciones/README_FILE_UPLOAD.md` - Comprehensive feature documentation
2. `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed technical changes document

- ✅ Sanitizes filenames
- ✅ Creates directory structure automatically
- ✅ Stores filename in database
- ✅ Session authentication required

### Sub-Area Selector
- ✅ Mandatory field (marked with red asterisk)
- ✅ Dynamic loading based on cargo selection
- ✅ Queries `adm_área` table for sub-areas
- ✅ Converts between text input and select dropdown
- ✅ Client-side validation
- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ Prevents empty or whitespace-only values

### Access Control
- ✅ Role-based page access
- ✅ 10 authorized roles configured
- ✅ Supports multiple role name formats
- ✅ API endpoint authentication

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Required
The following tests should be performed in the production/staging environment:

1. **File Upload Test**:
   ```
   1. Navigate to /m_capacitaciones/formulario.html
   2. Fill out the training form
   3. Select a test file (PDF or image, < 2MB)
   4. Submit the form
   5. Verify file exists in /m_capacitaciones/assets/docs/[new_id]/archivos/
   6. Verify database cap_formulario.archivo_adjunto is populated
   ```

2. **Sub-Area Selector Test**:
   ```
   1. Navigate to /m_capacitaciones/programacion.html
   2. Click "Nueva Programación" button
   3. Select a cargo from dropdown
   4. Observe sub-area field updates (should show dropdown or text input)
   5. Try submitting without sub-area (should fail with validation error)
   6. Fill sub-area and submit (should succeed)
   7. Verify database cap_programacion.sub_area is populated
   ```

3. **Role Access Test**:
   ```
   1. Test with authorized role (e.g., Capacitador)
   2. Verify access to programacion.html is granted
   3. Test with unauthorized role
   4. Verify access is denied or redirected
   ```

### Test Data Needed
- Users with each of the 10 authorized roles
- Cargos with associated areas in adm_colaboradores
- Entries in adm_área table with sub_area values
- Sample files (PDF, JPG) under 2MB

## Database Requirements

### Tables Used
- `cap_formulario` - Stores training forms and file references
- `cap_programacion` - Stores training schedules
- `adm_área` - Contains areas and sub-areas
- `adm_colaboradores` - Contains employee data
- `adm_cargos` - Contains position/cargo data
- `adm_roles` - Contains user roles

### Migration Required
Ensure the migration `migration_add_session_management.sql` has been executed to add the `archivo_adjunto` column to `cap_formulario`.

## Security Summary

### File Upload Security
- ✅ File type validation (MIME type checking)
- ✅ File size restrictions (2MB)
- ✅ Filename sanitization (prevents directory traversal)
- ✅ Directory permissions (0755)
- ✅ Session authentication required
- ✅ Uploaded files excluded from git

### Application Security
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (prepared statements)
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Input validation on client and server
- ✅ String trimming to prevent whitespace attacks
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials

### Vulnerabilities Found
**None** - CodeQL analysis detected 0 security alerts

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Database migration executed
- [ ] Web server has write permissions to `/m_capacitaciones/assets/docs/`
- [ ] PHP upload settings configured (upload_max_filesize >= 2M, post_max_size >= 2M)
- [ ] All 10 roles exist in adm_roles table
- [ ] Test users available for each role
- [ ] Database backup completed

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] File upload test completed successfully
- [ ] Sub-area selector test completed successfully
- [ ] Role access test completed successfully
- [ ] Review error logs for any issues
- [ ] Monitor disk space in docs directory

## Known Limitations

1. File upload is optional (not required for form submission)
2. Maximum file size is hardcoded to 2MB
3. No file preview/download UI (files are stored but not displayed)
4. Sub-area options depend on existing data in database
5. No file virus scanning implemented
6. Single file upload only (no multiple files)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add file preview/download functionality
2. Add file management UI (delete, replace)
3. Implement file virus scanning
4. Add bulk file upload capability
5. Add upload progress indicator
6. Create automated tests
7. Implement file compression for large images
8. Add file metadata (upload date, uploader, etc.)

## Support and Maintenance

### Documentation
- `README_FILE_UPLOAD.md` - User and developer documentation
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Technical implementation details
- This file - Implementation completion summary

### Rollback Procedure
If issues occur:
1. Revert files: `file_upload_api.php`, `programacion_api.php`, `programacion.js`, `programacion.html`
2. Do NOT rollback database changes (they're additive)
3. Clear any uploaded test files from docs directory

### Monitoring
Monitor the following:
- Disk space in `/m_capacitaciones/assets/docs/`
- Error logs for file upload failures
- Database null values in cap_programacion.sub_area (should be none for new records)

## Conclusion

All requirements have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ File upload saves to correct directory structure
- ✅ Sub-area selector is mandatory and loads from adm_área table
- ✅ Role restrictions are properly configured
- ✅ Code quality validated (syntax, review, security)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation provided

The implementation is ready for deployment to staging/production environment pending manual testing.
